# MM-202 Exam Unit 3
Welcome to my submission for Exam Unit 3. I have used unit testing to the best of my ability using Xunit. In Program.cs I have added some of my tasks to be visualized in Terminal using different methods such as reading a file directly from a Json file and using the webites given to always have something new to test.

## Run the program and test
```
dotnet run
dotnet test
```
